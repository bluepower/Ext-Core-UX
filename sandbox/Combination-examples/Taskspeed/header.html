<h1><span>Task<span class="strike">Slick</span>Speed</span></h1>

<h2>basic task test for frameworks.</h2>

<p>This is not SlickSpeed, though uses the same framework.</p>

<p>Tests are run against a local copy of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-css3-selectors-20011113/">this document</a>. They add, remove, append, connect and otherwise mangle the DOM as defined by the <a href="tests/sample-tests.js">sample-tests.js</a> file.

<p>These results are [optionally] reported back. There are <a href="report/charts.html">Charts being generated from this data</a></p>
