<h3>Layout Model</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Layout is delegated by containers to a specific layout class</li>
	<li>Nested containers can each contain a separate layout, allowing for extremely complex user interfaces</li>
	<li>Layouts manage the display of components added to them, eliminating box model issues, scroll bar issues and other traditional complexities of combining widgets into a UI</li>
</ul>
